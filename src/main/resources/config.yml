# You can specify the intervals (wait times) between each tick of the growth task per world.
# These values are in ticks, not seconds. There is approximately 20 ticks in one real second
# so keep that in mind (IE 300 ticks = every 15 seconds).
#
# Simply follow the style in the file. Keys are world names.
#
# WARNING: Setting a value too low will be too intensive for servers with many custom crops.
#          Three hundred is typically a good compromise but feel free to experiment and see
#          what works for you.
